## Name
HSS Inc. Accesibility Update-Paul Todd

## Description
The project assigned was to take HSS incs, exisisting code base and make it as accessible as possible at my current level of knowledge
To make changes the first step was identifying problems within index.html and style.css.
Within index.html the following problems were discovered and edited:
1. Added comments to indentify each individial section of the webpage as well as rename the <div> to header, main, aside and forward.
2. Changed title from "title" to "Fully Accesible HSS inc." 
3. Changed .header <div> to <nav>.
4. Moved the hero to the header section and renamed the class from "hero" to "header-image".
5. Changed .main <div> to <main>
6. Changed all div classes within main to ids. 
7. Added alt tags to all images along with short discriptions of the images themselves.
8. Changed .benifits <div> tag to <aside>
9. Removed </img> tag from the end of <img> cost-managment.
10. Changed all <div class =""> classes within <aside> to ids.

Within the style.css file the following changes were made:
1. Reordered properly in terms of specificity.
2. updated classes from index.html that were changed to ids and modified them:
    1. #search-engine-optimization
    2. #online-reputation-management
    3. #social-media-marketing
    4. #benefit-lead
    5. #benefit-brand
    6. #benefit-cost
3. Within these Ids I was able stack:
    1. All ID rules 
    2. All ID img rules
    3. All ID h2 and h3 rules
4. Added comments to easily identify sections.
